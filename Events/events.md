In Node.js, the events module is used to handle asynchronous events. It allows developers to create and listen for custom events in a way that’s more structured and scalable than using callbacks alone.

Node.js is built around non-blocking, asynchronous I/O. The events module helps manage actions that occur over time (e.g., file read completion, HTTP requests, etc.).

Node.js uses an event-driven model — meaning much of its core functionality is built on emitting and listening for events. For example:

An HTTP server emits a 'request' event.

A stream emits 'data', 'end', or 'error'.
